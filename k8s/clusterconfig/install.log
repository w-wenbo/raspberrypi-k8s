Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join wangwenbo.local:6443 --token 0kqeyg.2uqf12t30in1k14h \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:f5c7a1b3c268c036b01507343d874340c8ffcf5f30ef85c0ef1b00ae6cb2a0e8 \
	--control-plane --certificate-key d8231445a38044d29a6ce645a9339c0fa1bef32263310dcbfd7c20e7302d9a46

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join wangwenbo.local:6443 --token 0kqeyg.2uqf12t30in1k14h \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:f5c7a1b3c268c036b01507343d874340c8ffcf5f30ef85c0ef1b00ae6cb2a0e8
